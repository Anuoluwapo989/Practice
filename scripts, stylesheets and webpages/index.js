// Hala, you can work on the button for start and a function that takes it from page1.html to page2.html on click.
//We need to have a function that spawns two of each card type onto the page at random slots
//We also need a function that counts the users score and returns "game over" if they lose and "congratulations" if they win.
// We also need to connect the pages when an event listener is active
// I'm trying the event listener rn
// var button = document.getElementById("");
// button.addEventListener( click, function(){
//     document.location.href("http://localhost:8080");
// });
